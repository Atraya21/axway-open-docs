| IAP-2157     | 985413             | **Issue**: When entering external credentials for an application a generic 'Something Went Wrong!' error page was displayed if the external credentials were already used by another application. **Resolution**: API Portal now displays a specific error message when duplicate external credentials are entered.                                                                                          |
| IAP-2160     | 1016059            | **Issue**: When the user is on API Details page the active API Catalog menu is not highlighted. **Resolution**: The correct API Catalog nav menu item is highlighted when an API from it is opened.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| IAP-2167     | 1031445            | **Issue**: When Authorization code flow is disabled in API Manager this API can not be loaded in API Portal. **Resolution**: There is no search explicitly for authorization code data anymore, and the page is properly loaded.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| IAP-2224     | 1034603            | **Issue**: Some strings from API description in markdown are not properly encode in API Details page. **Resolution**: The whole API description is encoded and sanitized using the markdown language.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| IAP-2226     |                    | **Issue**: Metrics buttons were shown in the Applications page even if the corresponding manager does not support them. **Resolution**: Metrics buttons in the Applications page are shown only if the corresponding manager supports them.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| IAP-2233     | 1024460            | **Issue**: API Portal overwrites Content-Type header with multipart-formdata. **Resolution**: API Portal does not change the value of the Content-Type header anymore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| IAP-2256     | 1066320            | **Issue**: When there is an example body with some really long string in it, for example, for some value, the example body editor changes its width. **Resolution**: Despite the length of the key or value in the example body, the body editor is with fixed width.                                                                                                                                     |
| IAP-2259     | 01064113, 01054690 | **Issue**: When the user is on monitoring tab in the Application page and there are no requests the description is misleading - it shows that the requests are from None organization. Also the requests table shows application id but its column is Application name. **Resolution**: When there are no requests the description is not shown. The column is renamed to "Application".                     |
| IAP-2272     |                    | **Issue**: Tags, Type, and Download definitions do not show up on API Test page in Internet Explorer 11. **Resolution**: The correct data for Tags, Type, and Download definitions are recognized on API Test page in Internet Explorer 11.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| IAP-2277     |                    | **Issue**: When recaptcha appears on login page and correct credentials are entered, user is redirected to password reset page (happens when password expire and password change on first login are enabled in API Manager and the user has expired password or this is his/her first login). **Resolution**: When trying to submit the login form without validating the recaptcha, error message is shown. |
| IAP-2287     | 1063673            | **Issue**: Application and API images are not displaying in Applications and API Catalog pages in Internet Explorer 11. **Resolution**: Images are correctly displayed in Application and API Catalog pages for Internet Explorer 11.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| IAP-2296     | 1068022            | **Issue**: Swagger definition is downloaded along with axway specific sensitive data. **Resolution**: Swagger definition is downloaded without sensitive data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| IAP-2301     |                    | **Issue**: Everywhere when we have accordion with JsonSchema in it, the area below it is collapsed by default and it has to be explicitly clicked so it could fill with data. **Resolution**: Now when you expand an accordion it fills with JsonSchema immediately.                                                                                                                                         |
| IAP-2305     | 1064337            | **Issue**: SSO was unsuccessful in use case of sticky session configuration of Load Balancer in-front of two or more API Managers. **Resolution**: Using a load balancer with sticky session as a entry point for several instances of API Managers, does not cause issues with SSO.                                                                                                                          |
| IAP-2309     |                    | **Issue**: Newly created menu items have incorrect segments added to the URL. **Resolution**: Newly created menu items use the alias as URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| IAP-2327     |                    | **Issue**: Non-API Manager users can sign in to API Portal. **Resolution**: Disable Non-API Manager user login.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| IAP-2328     |                    | **Issue**: API Portal stops working when the cache handler is changed to File. **Resolution**: Cache data is wiped out when the cache handler is changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| IAP-2337     | 1054699            | **Issue**: API Portal user could not login to slave API Manager when the password contains special characters: `%` and `&`. **Resolution**: API Portal user successfully login to slave API Manager when the password contains special characters. (On upgrade from RTM 7.7 you must manually download and apply new Sample Policy Configuration file.)                                                      |
| IAP-2365     | 1068031            | **Issue**: Invoke policy name and description are not shown. **Resolution**: Invoke policy name and description are displayed where they are supposed to be and when they are needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| IAP-2444     | 1075963            | **Issue**: Description from Swagger objects properties does not show up in API details page. **Resolution**: Description for Swagger object properties are displayed next to properties types. (Displaying an description for Array of objects is supported only for first level of nested objects).                                                                                                          |
| IAP-2464     | 1082546            | **Issue**: Last Visited field in user profile page always shows "Never". **Resolution**: Last Visited field in user profile shows last login time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| IAP-2466     | 1082179            | **Issue**: Typo in SSO login error message. **Resolution**: Typo is fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| IAP-2467     | 1081280            | **Issue**: Application tab in API Tester page is always accessible, even if Applications page is disabled in Public API Mode. **Resolution**: Guest users never see the Application tab with enabled Public API mode. Tab mechanism is improved.                                                                                                                                                             |
